## What Is This?

RAG AI System is a fully local Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that lets you upload a PDF and ask natural-language questions against it — with the answer streamed token-by-token directly to your browser.

Most document Q&A tools send your files to OpenAI or some other cloud service. This project keeps the entire pipeline on your machine: a MiniLM embedding model converts your document into semantic vectors, a pure-Python cosine-search index retrieves the most relevant paragraphs, and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct generates a grounded answer from those paragraphs alone.

There are no external API calls, no database services, and no internet connection required after the models are downloaded.

| File                 | Responsibility                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.py`            | Streamlit UI — chat interface, file upload, streaming output        |
| `local_llm.py`       | `AiModel` — loads Qwen, builds RAG prompt, streams token output     |
| `local_embedding.py` | `LocalEmbedding` — MiniLM wrapper and vector index interface        |
| `vector_index.py`    | `VectorIndex` — pure-stdlib in-memory cosine/Euclidean vector store |
| `pdf_reader.py`      | `PdfReader` — PDF text extraction and paragraph splitting           |

## Screenshots

### Upload screen — ready state

![Upload screen](application_screenshots/image_2.png)

The sidebar shows **LLM ready** once the Qwen model has loaded. The PDF uploader accepts drag-and-drop or file browser. The chat area waits for a document before accepting questions.

---

### Active conversation

After indexing, answers stream token-by-token into the chat. The sidebar displays the paragraph count for the indexed document. Follow-up questions reuse the cached index without re-embedding.

## Feature List

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation

- PDF ingestion with automatic paragraph extraction and whitespace normalisation
- Batch embedding of all paragraphs in a single GPU pass — no per-paragraph round trips
- Cosine similarity search over 384-dimensional MiniLM vectors
- Configurable top-k retrieval to pass the most relevant context chunks to the LLM
- Strict grounding prompt — the model is instructed to answer only from the provided document text

### Streaming Output

- `TextIteratorStreamer` runs `model.generate()` in a background daemon thread
- Tokens are yielded through the streamer queue without blocking the Streamlit main thread
- `st.write_stream()` renders tokens progressively as they arrive in the browser

### Caching and Session Management

- `@st.cache_resource` loads the LLM once per server process; Streamlit reruns do not reload model weights
- `st.session_state` persists the embedding index across follow-up questions without re-indexing
- Uploading a new PDF resets the session and builds a fresh index automatically

### Pure-Python Vector Store

- `VectorIndex` uses no NumPy, FAISS, or external vector database
- Vectors are L2-normalised at index time; similarity search reduces to a dot-product scan over stored vectors
- Both Euclidean and cosine metrics are available in the same class

---

## How It Works

1. **PDF → Paragraphs** — `PdfReader` reads every page, normalises whitespace, and splits on paragraph breaks, yielding a clean list of text chunks.

2. **Paragraphs → Vectors** — `LocalEmbedding.build_index()` batch-embeds all paragraphs in one GPU pass using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and stores the 384-dimensional L2-normalised vectors in `VectorIndex`.

3. **Question → Context** — at query time the question is embedded and compared against every stored vector by cosine distance; the top-k highest-scoring chunks are concatenated into a single context string.

4. **Context + Question → Answer** — `AiModel` wraps the context and question in a strict RAG prompt, launches `model.generate()` in a background daemon thread, and yields tokens through `TextIteratorStreamer` so `st.write_stream()` can render them progressively in the browser.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement          | Notes                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Python 3.10+         | Earlier versions not tested                  |
| CUDA-capable GPU     | Recommended; CPU inference works but is slow |
| Hugging Face account | Free — needed for `HF_TOKEN`                 |

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Mohamad-Hachem/RAG_AI_SYSTEM.git
cd RAG_AI_SYSTEM

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate   # Windows (Git Bash)
# source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS / Linux

# Install PyTorch with CUDA 12.1 support
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Install remaining dependencies
pip install transformers streamlit pypdf python-dotenv huggingface_hub
```

> **GPU note:** the `cu121` wheel targets CUDA 12.1. Find the right wheel for your GPU at [pytorch.org/get-started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). For CPU-only: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio`.

### Add your Hugging Face token

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
HF_TOKEN=hf_your_token_here
```

Get a free token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens). Read access is sufficient — neither model is gated, but the hub login step requires a token.

---

## Usage

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Streamlit will print a local URL (default `http://localhost:8501`). Open it in your browser.

> **First run:** both models are downloaded from HuggingFace Hub and cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/`. This takes a few minutes depending on your connection. Subsequent runs start in seconds.

### Basic workflow

1. Wait for **"LLM ready"** in the sidebar — the Qwen model has finished loading.
2. Drag and drop any PDF onto the uploader, or click **Browse**.
3. Wait for **"Document ready — N paragraphs indexed"** in the sidebar.
4. Type your question in the chat input at the bottom and press Enter.
5. The answer streams token-by-token. Ask follow-up questions freely — the index is cached.
6. Upload a new PDF to start a fresh conversation.

## Limitations

- **Single document at a time** — the index holds one PDF; there is no multi-document or cross-document Q&A.
- **In-memory index only** — `VectorIndex` is not persisted to disk; re-uploading the same PDF re-embeds it from scratch on every run.
- **Linear scan** — similarity search scans every stored vector; performance degrades on very large documents with thousands of paragraphs.
- **Paragraph chunking only** — the splitter uses whitespace-based paragraph breaks; fixed-token sliding-window chunking is not implemented.
- **Context window cap** — the top-k chunks must fit within Qwen's context window; very long paragraphs or a high `k` value can exceed it.
- **CPU inference is slow** — without a CUDA device, generation at 3B parameters takes significantly longer than real-time.
- **Cold start** — first run downloads both models from HuggingFace Hub, which can take several minutes depending on network speed.
- **Single-turn grounding** — the RAG prompt is rebuilt from scratch on every question; there is no conversation memory carried across turns.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Persistent index** — serialize `VectorIndex.vectors` and `.documents` to disk so documents do not need to be re-embedded on every startup.
- **Multi-document support** — merge indices from several PDFs into one `VectorIndex` for cross-document Q&A.
- **Sliding-window chunking** — replace paragraph splits with fixed-token overlapping windows for more uniform chunk sizes and better boundary handling.
- **ANN indexing** — replace linear scan with an approximate nearest-neighbour structure (e.g. HNSW) for sub-linear search at scale.
- **Quantized inference** — add `load_in_4bit=True` via `bitsandbytes` to run larger models on smaller GPUs.
- **Larger LLM support** — swap `model_name` in `AiModel.__init__` to any HuggingFace causal model (e.g. `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct`, `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`).
- **Conversation memory** — accumulate prior Q&A turns in the RAG prompt for contextually aware follow-up answers.
- **Embedding progress bar** — show per-paragraph indexing progress during PDF ingestion rather than a single blocking wait.
